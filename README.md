## <a name="http"> What is HTTP? </a>
**HTTP** = Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
**WWW** = World Wide Web
**HTML** = Hyper Text Markup Language

WWW is about communication between web clients and web servers.

**Clients** = e.g. browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge).
**Servers** = e.g. computers in the cloud

Communication requests and responses:
- A client (a browser) sends an HTTP request to the web
- An web server receives the request
- The server runs an application to process the request
- The server returns an HTTP response (output) to the browser
- The client (the browser) receives the response

Typical HTTP circle:
- The browser requests an HTML page. The server returns an HTML file.
- The browser requests a style sheet. The server returns a CSS file.
- The browser requests an JPG image. The server returns a JPG file.
- The browser requests JavaScript code. The server returns a JS file
- The browser requests data. The server returns data (in XML or JSON).
